    "# Update 21 June 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned a lot at the hackathon on June 10-11th and decided to regenerate the primary data set. This is called the `v3` primary data set. The changes, compared to `v2` are: the noise background is gaussian white noise instead of noise from the Sun, the signal amplitudes are higher and the characteristics should make them more distinguishable, and there are only 140k in the full set (20k per signal type), compared with 350k previously (50k per signal type).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `basic` data set remains unchanged from before.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Code Challenge, you will be using the **\"primary\" data set**, as we've called it. The primary data set is   \n",
    "\n",
    "    * labeled data set of 140,000 simulated signals\n",
    "    * 7 different labels, or \"signal classifications\"\n",
    "    * total of about 51 GB of data\n",
    "    \n",
    "This data set should be used to train your models. \n",
    "\n",
    "**You do not need to use all the data to train your models** if you do not want to or need to consume the entire set. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also a **`small` and a `medium` sized subset** of these primary data files. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data file has a simple format: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * file name = <UUID>.dat\n",
    "    * a JSON header in the first line that contains:\n",
    "        * UUID\n",
    "        * signal_classification (label)\n",
    "    * followed by stream complex-valued time-series data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `ibmseti` Python package is available to assist in reading this data and performing some basic operations for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Warmup Data Set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a second, simple and clean data set that you may use for warmup, which we call the **\"basic\" data set**. This basic set should be used as a sanity check and for very early-stage prototyping. We recommend that everybody starts with this. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Only 4 different signal classifications\n",
    "    * 1000 simulation files for each class: 4000 files total\n",

    "       \n",
    "### Basic Set versus Primary Set\n",
    "\n",
    "> The difference between the `basic` and `primary` data sets is that the signals simulated in the `basic` set have, on average, much higher signal to noise ratio (they are larger amplitude signals). They also have other characteristics that will make the different signal classes very distinguishable. **You should be able to get very high signal classification accuracy with the basic data set.**  The primary data set has smaller amplitude signals and can look more similar to each other, making classification accuracy more difficult with this data set. There are also only 4 classes in the basic data set and 7 classes in the primary set. \n",
